# Grid

The `Grid` component is a responsive layout utility built on Tailwind CSS’s `grid` classes. It helps organize content into structured rows and columns, ideal for building galleries, dashboards, and tiled layouts.

## Features

- Leverages Tailwind’s native `grid` utilities
- Supports responsive column/row control
- Customizable gaps and alignment
- Fully supports native HTML props (`id`, `className`, `aria-*`, etc.)

## Usage Guidelines

- Use `Grid` for structured content that benefits from column/row layout.
- Configure layout using `cols`, `rows`, and `gap` props (`grid-cols-3`, `grid-rows-2`, `gap-4`).
- Add Tailwind alignment classes via `justify` or `className` to control alignment inside the grid.
- Wrap individual grid items with layout components like `Box` or `Card`.

## Do

- Use `Grid` for visually structured layouts like cards or tiles
- Leverage responsive classes for adaptive column counts (`sm:grid-cols-2`, `lg:grid-cols-4`)
- Compose grid items with reusable components for consistency

## Don’t

- Overcomplicate the layout with deeply nested grids
- Use `Grid` for one-dimensional layouts—use `Flex` instead
- Forget to test with varying content lengths for visual consistency
