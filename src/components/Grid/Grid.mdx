# Grid

The `Grid` component is a responsive layout utility based on Tailwind CSS’s `grid` classes. It provides a structured way to arrange child components into rows and columns with consistent spacing and alignment.

---

## Usage Guidelines

- Use `Grid` when content should be laid out in a structured grid format rather than a flexible row/column.
- Define the number of columns using the `cols` prop (`grid-cols-2`, `grid-cols-4`, etc.).
- Use the `rows` prop if you need specific row definitions (`grid-rows-2`, `grid-rows-3`, etc.).
- Apply consistent spacing using the `gap` prop (`gap-2`, `gap-4`, etc.).
- Add Tailwind’s alignment classes using `justify` or `className` to center or align items within the grid.

## Best Practices

- Prefer `Grid` over `Flex` for structured content like cards, galleries, or dashboards.
- Use responsive utilities like `sm:grid-cols-2 md:grid-cols-4` for adaptive layouts.
- Avoid overcomplicating grid configurations — keep the layout readable and intuitive.
- Combine with `Box` for consistent styling and spacing within grid items.
- Test with varying content lengths to ensure grid alignment holds visually.
