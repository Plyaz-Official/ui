# Flex

`Flex` is a layout component that wraps Tailwind's flexbox utility classes into a reusable abstraction. It provides a flexible way to align and distribute space among child elements using familiar props like `direction`, `justify`, `align`, `wrap`, and `gap`.

Use `Flex` to simplify building layouts where elements need dynamic alignment or spacing along a row or column.

---

## Usage Guidelines

- Use `Flex` when you need horizontal or vertical layouts with spacing or alignment.
- Choose `direction="row"` for horizontal layouts, and `direction="col"` for vertical ones.
- Use the `wrap` prop to allow children to wrap on small screens.
- Apply spacing between children using Tailwind gap utilities via the `gap` prop.
- Avoid deeply nesting `Flex` inside `Flex`; if needed, separate responsibilities clearly (e.g., layout vs alignment).

---

## Best Practices

- Prefer semantic grouping with `Box` or `Section` around `Flex` for clearer structure.
- Ensure responsive design by adjusting `direction` or `wrap` conditionally using custom className overrides.
- Test `Flex` layouts with real content in Storybook using various viewport sizes.
