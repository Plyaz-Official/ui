# Stack

The `Stack` component is a layout utility that arranges its children either vertically or horizontally with consistent spacing using Tailwind's `space-*` utilities. It's perfect for simple layout composition without needing full Flexbox or Grid control.

---

## Usage Guidelines

- Use `Stack` when you need consistent spacing between elements in one direction.
- Choose `horizontal` for row alignment (e.g., buttons, badges) and `vertical` for column layouts (e.g., lists, cards).
- Apply spacing classes like `space-x-*` or `space-y-*` based on direction.
- Wrap `Stack` around layout primitives like `Box` or components like `Card`, `Button`, etc.

---

## Best Practices

- Use `Stack` to simplify layout logic instead of writing custom margin rules.
- Match `direction` with the correct spacing utility:
  - `horizontal` → `space-x-*`
  - `vertical` → `space-y-*`
- Don't mix directional spacing classes—let `Stack` handle layout direction internally.
- Combine with `Container` or `Section` for more structured layout blocks.
- Keep the DOM clean by limiting unnecessary nested wrappers inside `Stack`.
