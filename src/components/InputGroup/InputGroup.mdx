# InputGroup

`InputGroup` is a composite component that combines input fields with addons, buttons, and text elements. It provides a cohesive way to create complex input layouts with consistent styling and behavior.

The `InputGroup` system consists of multiple components that work together to create sophisticated input interfaces with icons, buttons, labels, and other UI elements.

## Features

- **Composite Design**: Combines multiple components into cohesive input groups
- **Flexible Alignment**: Supports inline and block alignment for addons and buttons
- **Multiple Addon Types**: Text, icons, buttons, and keyboard shortcuts
- **Accessibility First**: Built-in ARIA support, focus management, and screen reader compatibility
- **State Management**: Handles disabled, error states with proper visual feedback
- **Button Integration**: Seamless integration with Button component variants
- **Responsive Design**: Adapts to different screen sizes and layouts
- **Dark Mode Support**: Automatic dark mode styling
- **Form Library Compatible**: Works with react-hook-form, Formik, and other form libraries
- **Interactive Elements**: Support for tooltips, dropdowns, popovers, and spinners
- **Loading States**: Built-in support for loading indicators and disabled states

## Components

### InputGroup

The main container component that wraps all input group elements.

### InputGroupAddon

Container for addon elements with alignment variants (inline-start, inline-end, block-start, block-end).

### InputGroupButton

Button component optimized for use within input groups with size variants.

### InputGroupText

Text element for labels, prefixes, suffixes, and other text-based addons.

### InputGroupInput

Input field component that removes borders and integrates with the group styling.

### InputGroupTextarea

Textarea component that integrates with the input group layout.

## Usage Guidelines

- Always use `InputGroup` as the root container for input group components
- Use `InputGroupAddon` to wrap addon elements and control their alignment
- Combine `InputGroupText`, `InputGroupButton`, and icons within addons
- Use appropriate alignment variants for different layouts
- Provide meaningful labels and accessible button text
- Test keyboard navigation and screen reader compatibility

## Do

- Use `InputGroupAddon` to wrap all addon elements
- Choose appropriate alignment variants for your layout needs
- Use `InputGroupText` for text-based addons like labels and prefixes
- Use `InputGroupButton` for interactive elements within the group
- Provide proper ARIA labels for buttons and interactive elements
- Use semantic HTML elements and roles
- Test with keyboard navigation

## Don't

- Mix input group components with standalone input components
- Use addon components outside of `InputGroupAddon` containers
- Forget to handle disabled and error states consistently
- Use placeholder text as the only labeling mechanism
- Create overly complex layouts that confuse users
