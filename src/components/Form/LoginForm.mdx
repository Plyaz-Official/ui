# LoginForm

`LoginForm` is a simple, accessible authentication component for signing in users. It includes built-in validation, form state management with `useState`, and utility styling with Tailwind CSS. It's ideal for use in onboarding flows or secure sections of your application.

## Usage Guidelines

- Keep business logic (API calls, mutations) outside the component.
- Use this component where authentication is needed.
- Style consistently using Tailwind and layout primitives like `Box`.

## Best Practices

### Do

- Handle input state via a single `useState` object.
- Validate inputs before submission.
- Display inline error messages clearly and accessibly.

### Don’t

- Don’t include authentication logic in this component.
- Don’t submit empty or invalid data without feedback.
- Don’t hardcode multiple forms—make them reusable.

## Props

This component is self-contained and does not accept external props in this version

### Example

<Canvas of={LoginFormStories.Default} />

### Source Code

<Source of={LoginFormStories.Default} />
