# Signup Form

The `SignupForm` is a validated form pattern that includes name, email, and password fields. It provides inline error feedback, leverages Tailwind CSS for styling, and promotes accessible form practices.

## Features

- Validates `name`, `email`, and `password` fields
- Displays inline error messages
- Tailwind CSS-based styling
- Semantic markup with `label` and `input`
- Responsive and reusable structure

## Usage Guidelines

- Use `SignupForm` to onboard new users with a minimal and clean UI.
- Ensure form validation is client-side at a minimum; extend to server-side for production.
- This pattern fits most authentication and onboarding flows.

## Best Practices

### Do

- Use semantic `label` and `input` relationships
- Show meaningful validation messages
- Keep the form layout consistent using spacing utilities
- Centralize form state for scalability (e.g., with React state )

### Don’t

- Avoid nesting complex logic directly in JSX — extract logic if it grows
- Don’t hardcode style values; use Tailwind utilities
- Don’t submit invalid data without client-side validation

## Props
