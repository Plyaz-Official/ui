# Accordion

`Accordion` is a vertically stacked set of interactive headings that each reveal a section of content. It's built on top of Radix UI's accordion primitive and styled with Tailwind CSS for seamless integration.

The accordion component supports both single and multiple selection modes, with smooth animations and full keyboard accessibility.

## Features

- Single or multiple selection modes
- Smooth expand/collapse animations
- Keyboard accessible (Arrow keys, Enter, Space)
- Fully customizable with Tailwind CSS
- Collapsible option for single mode

## Usage Guidelines

- Use `type="single"` for exclusive selection (only one item open at a time)
- Use `type="multiple"` to allow multiple items to be open simultaneously
- Set `collapsible={true}` to allow closing the last open item in single mode
- Provide meaningful trigger text for accessibility
- Keep content concise and scannable

## Do

- Use accordions for organizing related content that doesn't need to be visible simultaneously
- Provide clear, descriptive trigger text
- Keep content sections reasonably sized
- Use single mode for sequential information

## Don't

- Use accordions for critical information that users need to see at once
- Nest accordions inside other accordions
- Make trigger text too long or vague
- Use multiple mode when single mode would be more appropriate
