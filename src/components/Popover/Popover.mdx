# Popover

`Popover` is a floating panel component that appears on top of the page content when triggered. It's built on top of Radix UI's Popover primitive and provides a flexible way to display contextual information or actions.

ShadCN's Popover is built on top of the Radix UI `popover` behavior and integrates seamlessly with Tailwind for customization and positioning.

## Features

- Multiple positioning options (`top`, `bottom`, `left`, `right`)
- Keyboard accessible by default
- Focus management and escape key handling
- Fully customizable with Tailwind CSS
- Portal rendering for proper z-index layering

## Usage Guidelines

- Use `PopoverTrigger` to define the element that opens the popover
- Use `PopoverContent` to define the content that appears in the popover
- Use `PopoverAnchor` for custom positioning if needed
- Prefer descriptive labels for accessibility

## Do

- Use for contextual information that doesn't require immediate attention
- Keep popover content concise and focused
- Provide clear visual indicators for the trigger element
- Use appropriate positioning to avoid content cutoff

## Don't

- Use for critical information that users must see
- Nest popovers inside other popovers
- Forget to handle keyboard navigation
- Make popover content too large or complex
