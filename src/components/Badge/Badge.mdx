# Badge

The `Badge` component is used to highlight small pieces of information like statuses, categories, or labels. It’s lightweight and can be customized using the `variant` prop.

## Features

- Lightweight label or status indicator
- Comes in multiple variants (`default`, `secondary`, `destructive`, `outline`)
- Fully styleable using Tailwind utility classes
- Accepts all standard `div` or `span` props
- Works well inline with buttons, cards, and text

## Usage Guidelines

Badges support multiple `variant`s (like `default`, `secondary`, `destructive`, `outline`) that help differentiate meaning through color and tone. Use these variants consistently across your application based on their intent (e.g., `destructive` for critical alerts, `outline` for subtle contexts).

Badges are **non-interactive by default** and should not be used as buttons unless wrapped with actionable elements explicitly.

## Do

- Use `Badge` to highlight status, category, or notification counts
- Combine with icons or actions if needed
- Use consistent color logic across your app (e.g., red = danger)

## Don’t

- Use `Badge` for large text or paragraphs
- Overload the UI with too many badges
- Use conflicting variants in close proximity
