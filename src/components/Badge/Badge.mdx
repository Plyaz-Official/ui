# Badge

`Badge` is a component used to display small pieces of information like status, counts, or labels. It supports multiple variants and can include icons. Built with class-variance-authority and styled with Tailwind CSS for seamless integration.

The badge component provides a consistent way to display status indicators, counts, and labels throughout your application.

## Features

- Multiple variants (`default`, `secondary`, `destructive`, `outline`)
- Support for icons and custom content
- Flexible rendering with `asChild` prop
- Accessible with proper focus styles
- Fully customizable with Tailwind CSS

## Usage Guidelines

- Use `variant="default"` for primary information
- Use `variant="secondary"` for secondary information
- Use `variant="destructive"` for errors or warnings
- Use `variant="outline"` for subtle information
