# TextReveal

The `TextReveal` component animates words individually based on scroll progress. It’s designed for storytelling or expressive headers, giving users a smooth word-by-word reveal as they scroll.

## Features

- Scroll-based word-by-word animation
- Uses `motion` from `framer-motion`
- Accepts a string as children and splits it into animated words
- Styled with Tailwind CSS for consistency and responsiveness
- Integrates seamlessly with dark/light modes

## Usage Guidelines

- Wrap content you want to reveal dynamically with `TextReveal`
- Ensure the `children` prop is a plain string
- Use for headings, hero sections, or interactive intros

## Do

- Use for visually impactful scroll-based text transitions
- Combine with large headers or narrative sections
- Use `className` to control layout and styling

## Don’t

- Pass non-string children (it will throw an error)
- Use for small body text or inline content
- Place inside very short scroll areas (it relies on scroll progress)

## Props

<Controls of={TextRevealStories.Base} />
