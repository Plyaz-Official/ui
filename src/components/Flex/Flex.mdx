# Flex

The `Flex` component is a layout utility built on top of Tailwind’s `flex` classes. It enables fast and consistent layout alignment across your UI using props for direction, alignment, justification, wrapping, and spacing.

## Features

- Built with Tailwind's `flex`, `gap`, `justify-*`, and `items-*` classes
- Controlled via props: `direction`, `justify`, `align`, `gap`, `wrap`
- Responsive-friendly with utility-first overrides
- Inherits all native HTML attributes (`id`, `className`, `aria-*`, etc.)

## Usage Guidelines

- Use `Flex` for horizontal or vertical layouts requiring spacing or alignment.
- `direction="row"` is best for horizontal alignment; `direction="col"` for vertical stacks.
- Combine with `gap`, `wrap`, and alignment props to build adaptive UIs.
- Wrap content or layout primitives (`Box`, `Card`, `Button`, etc.) inside `Flex` for structure.

## Do

- Use `Flex` to align buttons, inputs, icons, or layout blocks consistently
- Leverage `wrap` for responsiveness, especially with cards or badges
- Pair with `Container` or `Section` to build responsive layout zones

## Don’t

- Nest `Flex` elements too deeply—compose with intent
- Override `gap` with individual margins unless layout requires it
- Use `Flex` where `Grid` is more appropriate (e.g., structured card layouts)
