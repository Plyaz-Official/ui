# Layout

The `Layout` component is a flexible container for arranging UI elements using **CSS Grid** or **Flexbox**, powered by **Tailwind CSS** utility classes. It is ideal for building consistent, responsive structures across your application.

Use the `layout` prop to toggle between layout strategies:

- `"grid"` for multi-column arrangements
- `"flex"` for directional alignment

---

## Usage Guidelines

- Use `layout="grid"` for structured, grid-based layouts
- Use `layout="flex"` for horizontal or vertical stacks
- Combine with `gap`, `p`, `m`, or responsive utility classes for fine-tuned spacing

---

## Best Practices

### Do

- Choose layout based on content structure (`grid` for uniform content, `flex` for flow)
- Combine with spacing and alignment props like `gap`, `justify`, `align`
- Keep layout responsibilities separated from content logic

### Don’t

- Don’t mix layout-specific Tailwind classes (`flex`, `grid`) with the `layout` prop
- Don’t deeply nest layout components without semantic clarity
- Avoid inline styles that conflict with responsive utility classes
