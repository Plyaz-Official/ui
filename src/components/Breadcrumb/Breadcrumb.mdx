# Breadcrumb

`Breadcrumb` is a component used to display navigation hierarchy and help users understand their current location within a website or application. It provides a trail of links showing the path from the home page to the current page.

The breadcrumb component is built with accessibility in mind and provides proper ARIA attributes for screen readers.

## Features

- Accessible navigation with proper ARIA attributes
- Support for custom separators and ellipsis
- Flexible rendering with `asChild` prop
- Responsive design with proper spacing
- Support for icons and custom content

## Usage Guidelines

- Use breadcrumbs for deep navigation hierarchies
- Keep breadcrumb text concise and descriptive
- Always include a home link as the first item
- Use the current page as the last item (non-clickable)
- Consider using ellipsis for very long paths

## Do

- Use breadcrumbs for sites with deep navigation
- Keep text short and clear
- Include proper ARIA labels
- Use consistent separators

## Don't

- Use breadcrumbs for shallow navigation (1-2 levels)
- Make breadcrumb text too long
- Forget to mark the current page
- Use breadcrumbs as the primary navigation
