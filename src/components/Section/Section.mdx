# Section

`Section` is a semantically meaningful layout wrapper rendered as a `<section>` tag. It organizes content into visually and structurally distinct areas, with consistent spacing and styling powered by Tailwind CSS.

## Features

- Renders as a semantic `<section>` element
- Applies vertical spacing with `p-*`
- Fully styleable using Tailwind utility classes
- Accepts all valid HTML attributes (`id`, `aria-*`, `data-*`, etc.)
- Easily composable with layout components like `Container`, `Grid`, or `Box`

### Usage Guidelines

- Use `Section` to define high-level, logically grouped content areas (e.g., Features, Pricing, Testimonials).
- Pair with `Container` to control horizontal layout and alignment.
- Apply background and border styles via `className`.
- Add ARIA labels or heading tags inside for better accessibility.

### Do

- Use `Section` to organize your page into clear content blocks
- Combine with `Container` for content width control
- Add semantic value by pairing with headings (`h2`, `h3`, etc.)
- Pass native HTML props for accessibility (`aria-label`, `id`, etc.)

### Don’t

- Over-nest `Section` inside other layout containers unnecessarily
- Use `Section` alone for complex layouts — combine with `Box`, `Flex`, or `Grid`
- Treat `Section` as a generic wrapper — it has semantic meaning

## Props

<Controls of={SectionStories.Default} />

### Examples

### Default Section

<Canvas of={SectionStories.Default} />

### Source Code

<Source of={SectionStories.Default} language="tsx" />
