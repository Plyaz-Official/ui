#  Section

The `Section` component represents a semantically meaningful region of a page, wrapped in a `<section>` tag. It provides padding and spacing using Tailwind CSS, and is typically used to organize the layout into logical content blocks.

---

## Usage Guidelines

- Use `Section` to divide content into visually and semantically distinct areas.
- Ideal for wrapping thematic blocks like "Features", "Pricing", or "Testimonials".
- Combine `Section` with `Container` to limit content width inside a full-width section.
- Apply background colors or borders using Tailwind classes to visually distinguish sections.

---

## Best Practices

- Keep `Section` usage limited to top-level layout blocks; avoid deeply nesting.
- Don't rely solely on `Section` for visual spacing â€” pair with layout primitives like `Box`, `Grid`, or `Flex` inside.
- Ensure accessibility by labeling sections with appropriate ARIA attributes or headings when needed.
