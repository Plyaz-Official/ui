# AuroraText

`AuroraText` is a visually enhanced text component from Magic UI designed to render glowing, animated, or gradient-styled typography. It’s ideal for titles, callouts, or any text you want to highlight with visual flair.

It leverages Tailwind CSS and `framer-motion` to apply animated gradient effects and color transitions to text content.

---

## Features

- Built-in animated gradient or glow effects
- Fully customizable via Tailwind classes
- Works with any valid text content
- Responsive and theme-aware (light/dark)
- Integrates seamlessly into headings, paragraphs, or standalone UI blocks

---

## Usage Guidelines

- Use `AuroraText` to highlight key text like hero titles, product names, or marketing phrases.
- Prefer minimal use for emphasis—avoid overusing animated text throughout a page.
- Combine with `Heading` or `Text` for structured typography.

---

## Do

- Use it for attention-grabbing titles or callouts
- Combine with Tailwind text utilities for size and weight
- Adjust gradient and animation styles via props or className

## Don’t

- Use for large bodies of paragraph text
- Animate too many instances on the same screen—it can be visually overwhelming
- Use without fallbacks in environments where animation is disabled
