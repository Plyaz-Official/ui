# LanguageSelector

`LanguageSelector` is a specialized Select component designed for switching between available locales in internationalized applications. It provides a dropdown interface for users to change the application's language with proper routing and maintains the current page context during language changes.

This component is built on top of the base `Select` component and is specifically tailored for locale switching scenarios.

## Features

- Specialized Select component for locale switching
- Built on Radix UI's accessible Select primitive
- Supports React transitions for smooth locale changes
- Maintains page context during language switches
- Flexible label customization through `getLabel` function
- Disabled state support during transitions

## Usage Guidelines

- Use `LanguageSelector` when you need to provide language/locale switching functionality
- Always provide a `getLabel` function that returns user-friendly locale names
- Handle the `disabled` state during locale transitions to prevent conflicts
- Use with proper routing libraries (like `next-intl`) for seamless navigation

## Do

- Provide meaningful locale labels in the user's current language
- Handle the `onChange` callback to trigger proper routing
- Use the `disabled` prop during transition states
- Pass all available locales from your routing configuration

## Don't

- Use for general selection purposes (use `Select` instead)
- Hardcode locale labelsâ€”always use the `getLabel` function
- Forget to handle the disabled state during transitions
- Use without proper internationalization setup
