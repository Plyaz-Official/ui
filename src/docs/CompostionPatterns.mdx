# Component Composition

In this design system, layout components like `Flex` and `Grid` are derived from the base `Box` component, which ensures consistent styling, spacing, and responsiveness using Tailwind CSS.

---

### Composition Guidelines

- Use `Box` for generic layout blocks or wrappers.
- Use `Flex` when you need horizontal/vertical alignment and gap control.
- Use `Grid` for multi-column layouts.
- Compose components by nesting them cleanly inside each other.

### Example: Product Card Layout (using `Box`, `Flex`, and `Grid`)

```tsx
<Box className="p-4 rounded-lg shadow bg-white">
  <Flex className="gap-2 mb-4">
    <Box className="bg-green-400 p-3 text-white rounded">Item 1</Box>
    <Box className="bg-green-400 p-3 text-white rounded">Item 2</Box>
  </Flex>

  <Grid cols="grid-cols-2" className="gap-4 mb-4">
    <Box className="bg-gray-100 aspect-square rounded">Item 1</Box>
    <Box className="bg-gray-100 aspect-square rounded">Item 12</Box>
  </Grid>
</Box>
```
