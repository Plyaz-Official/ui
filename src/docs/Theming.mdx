# Theming

Our system supports both light and dark themes using Tailwindâ€™s `dark:` variants.

### Dark Mode in Storybook

Dark mode in Storybook is enabled via the toolbar toggle, which adds the dark class to the parent element. This allows Tailwind's dark: utilities to function as expected without additional setup.

```tsx
<Box className="bg-white dark:bg-gray-900 text-black dark:text-white">
  Theme aware component
</Box>
```
