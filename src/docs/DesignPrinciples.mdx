# Design Principles

Our design system is guided by a set of principles that ensure clarity, usability, and consistency across all components.

### Simplicity

- Design with clarity and minimalism in mind
- Present information in a structured, easy-to-scan layout

### Consistency

- Use shared spacing, typography, and color tokens
- Stick to layout and interaction patterns

### Accessibility

- Every component is keyboard and screen-reader accessible
- Follow WCAG guidelines for contrast and semantic structure

### Responsiveness

- Design mobile-first with adaptive layouts
- Utilize Tailwind's responsive utility classes (sm:, md:, lg:, etc.)
